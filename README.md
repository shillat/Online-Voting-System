# 🗳️ Online Voting System

##  Project Overview

This project is a full-stack, secure, and modern online voting platform designed by Ms. Naigaga Shillah, a Software Engineering Student, to facilitate paperless, transparent, and accessible election processes. It includes a robust **Spring Boot (Java)** backend for API and data management, and a dynamic **React (JavaScript)** frontend for the user interface.

##  Technology Stack
| Component | Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | **React** (with Hooks/Router) | Provides a responsive and interactive user experience for voters and administrators. |
| **Backend** | **Spring Boot (Java)** | Handles business logic, security, and RESTful API endpoints. |
| **Database** | *(Assumed)* **MySQL/PostgreSQL/H2** | For persistent storage of voter, candidate, and election data. |
| **Styling** | **CSS/Tailwind/Bootstrap** *(Based on project files)* | For application styling and layout. |

## 🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the project locally for development and testing.
### Prerequisites

  * **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+**
  * **Maven** (for the Backend)
  * **Node.js & npm** (for the Frontend)
  * A suitable **IDE** (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, Eclipse)

### 1\. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:bos-com/Online-Voting-System.git
cd Online-Voting-System
```

### 2\. Backend Setup (Java/Spring Boot)

1.  Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  **Configure Database:** Edit the connection properties in `src/main/resources/application.properties` to point to your local database instance.
    *Example:*
    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/voting_db
    spring.datasource.username=root
    spring.datasource.password=your_password
    ```
3.  **Build and Run:** Use Maven to compile and start the Spring Boot application:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The backend will typically start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### 3\. Frontend Setup (React)

1.  Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend/voting-client
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the Application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The frontend application will typically open in your browser on `http://localhost:3000`.
